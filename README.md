A fun twist on an old classic. This Hangman spinoff is based on an aged astronaut who ventures into a strange wormhole. When he comes out on the other side he finds that his body is slowly disappearing. Its up to you and your friends to save him with the power of words... will you be able to do it? Or will he be lost to the stars forever.
